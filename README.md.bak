## Development environment setup instruction (latest version)

We are using visitor design pattern between processing, starbucks.jar and new screens.

All the new screens are under team project folder now. 

1) Here is the source code for implementing the team project: https://github.com/nguyensjsu/fa18-202-mystic/tree/master/yinghua_qin/starbucksTeamSource

2) Here is the latest processing code: https://github.com/nguyensjsu/fa18-202-mystic/tree/master/yinghua_qin/starbucks_processing_v2

3) Here is the two library we use. Please check the readme file here for how to use them.  https://github.com/nguyensjsu/fa18-202-mystic/tree/master/yinghua_qin/starbucksJarLibraries
